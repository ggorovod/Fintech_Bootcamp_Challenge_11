   - Visual depictions of seasonality (as measured by Google Search traffic) that are of interest to the company.

   - An evaluation of how the company’s stock price correlates to its Google Search traffic.

   - A Prophet forecast model that can predict hourly user search traffic.

   - Answers to questions in the instructions that you write in your Jupyter Notebook.

   - A plot of a forecast for the company’s future revenue.
